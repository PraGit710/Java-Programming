## I have used IntelliJ IDEA code Editor and used following libraries ->
1. Apache Mahout
2. Json Simple
3. Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J)
4. Guava
5. Commons math


Apache Mahout – A machine learning library designed for scalable data mining and machine learning algorithms, particularly for clustering, classification, and recommendation systems.

JSON Simple – A lightweight library for parsing, generating, and manipulating JSON data in Java applications.

Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) – A logging framework that provides a simple abstraction over various logging frameworks like Logback and Log4j, allowing flexible logging implementations.

Guava – A set of core Java libraries developed by Google, offering enhanced utilities for collections, caching, concurrency, string processing, and functional programming.

Apache Commons Math – A mathematics and statistics library that provides tools for numerical computation, including linear algebra, optimization, and random data generation.

These libraries collectively enhance your project's capabilities in data processing, logging, machine learning, and mathematical computations.
